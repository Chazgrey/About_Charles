# 👋 Hi, I'm Charles

I'm a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data visualization**. I'm currently venturing into **machine learning** and building predictive models to solve real-world problems. I enjoy transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights and compelling visual stories.

## 🔍 What I Do
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Interactive and static data visualization
- Building and evaluating machine learning models (beginner to intermediate level)
- End-to-end data science workflows

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Data Analysis & ML**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI (learning)
- **Other**: Git & GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## 📂 Projects
This repository is my space to showcase personal projects, practice new techniques, and experiment with datasets. You'll find:
- EDA and visualization projects on real-world datasets
- Early machine learning experiments (classification, regression, clustering)
- Ongoing work as I deepen my ML skills

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements—I'm always learning!

## 🌱 Currently Growing In
- Machine learning fundamentals and advanced techniques
- Model deployment and MLOps basics
- Deepening statistical modeling and feature engineering

## 📫 Let's Connect
I'm actively seeking:
- **Mentorship** from experienced data scientists/ML engineers
- **Collaborations** on open-source or personal projects
- Opportunities to **contribute** to meaningful data science work
